### Timer Application**

### **Overview**
This project is a graphical Timer Application built using Python's `tkinter` library. The application provides users with a simple and interactive interface to set and manage timers, view the current time, and use predefined quick-timer settings for common tasks. The timer supports start, pause, resume, and stop functionalities, ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

### **Features**
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time at the top of the application.
- **Custom Timer**: Users can input custom hours, minutes, and seconds for the timer.
- **Quick-Timer Presets**: Buttons for predefined timers:
  - Brushing Timer (2 minutes)
  - Face Care Timer (15 minutes)
  - Egg Cooking Timer (10 minutes)
- **Control Buttons**: 
  - **Start**: Starts the timer.
  - **Pause**: Pauses the timer without resetting the countdown.
  - **Resume**: Resumes the timer after being paused.
  - **Stop**: Stops the timer and resets it to `00:00:00`.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays an audio alert (`assets/audio/open.mp3`) when the timer completes.
- **Window Close Handling**: Ensures the timer stops when the application window is closed.

### **Installation**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required modules: `tkinter`, `playsound`
   - An audio file (`open.mp3`) in the directory `assets/audio/`.
   - Images (`brush.png`, `face.png`, `eggs.png`) in the directory `assets/images/`.

2. **Steps to Run**:
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Install the `playsound` package:
     ```bash
     pip install playsound
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python timer.py
     ```

### **Future Suggestions**
1. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Use modern design frameworks like `ttk` or `customtkinter` for a polished look.
   - Add animations to buttons when pressed for better feedback.
   
2. **Additional Timer Features**:
   - **Repeat Timer**: Add an option to repeat the timer multiple times.
   - **Custom Alarm Sound**: Let users select their own notification sound.
   - **Progress Bar**: Visual progress bar to show the countdown.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate timer input fields to ensure only numbers are entered.
   - Show an error message for invalid or blank inputs.

4. **Customization Options**:
   - Allow users to save frequently used timer presets.
   - Provide themes for the application (dark, light, etc.).

5. **System Tray Integration**:
   - Minimize the app to the system tray and show notifications when the timer ends.

6. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Package the application as an executable for Windows, macOS, and Linux using tools like `PyInstaller`.

7. **Mobile Compatibility**:
   - Develop a mobile version of the app using `Kivy`.
